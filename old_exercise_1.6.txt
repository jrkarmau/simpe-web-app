1. checked what kind of plans and instructions where with fly.io.
2. Created account and added billing info.
3. Installed flyctl
4. Followed the instructions and tried to deploy my older project but the free tier memory limit crashed my application. So i used this course part devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service and deployed that with command fly launch and followed instructions.
